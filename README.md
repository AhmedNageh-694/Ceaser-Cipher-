# Ceaser-Cipher-
 Python program that uses the Caesar cipher to encrypt data and has a GUI built with the Tkinter library
 The program creates a simple GUI with an input text area, a shift value entry, an encrypt button, an output text area, and a clear button. When the encrypt button is clicked, the program encrypts the input text using the Caesar cipher with the specified shift value and displays the encrypted text in the output text area. When the clear button is clicked, the program clears the input and output text areas and resets the shift value to 0.

Note that this implementation of the Caesar cipher is not very secure and should not be used for sensitive data.
